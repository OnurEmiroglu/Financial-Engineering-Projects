# Financial Engineering Projects

This repository contains selected academic projects completed during my Master's in Financial Engineering at KIT (Hector School, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology).

Each project demonstrates practical applications of quantitative finance, statistical modeling, and machine learning in Python.

## 1. Kalman Filter for Vasicek Interest Rate Model
**File:** `Kalman_Filter_Vasicek.ipynb`  
- Estimated hidden state variables under the Vasicek short-rate model using Kalman Filter.  
- Derived Maximum Likelihood Estimations (MLE) for model parameters.  
- Visualized filtered vs. observed yields.

## 2. Machine Learning for Return Prediction
**File:** `Machine_Learning_Return_Prediction.ipynb`  
- Compared 10 ML models (Lasso, Ridge, XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.) for asset return forecasting.  
- Evaluated portfolio strategies using performance metrics and Diebold-Mariano tests.  
- Analyzed feature importance and volatility regime dynamics.

## 3. EM4 Analytical Part
**File:** `EM4_Analytical_Part.ipynb`  
- Derived stochastic differential equations (SDEs) for interest rate dynamics.  
- Applied Itoâ€™s Lemma for analytical bond pricing under Vasicek model assumptions.  
- Prepared as part of the EM4 module exam at KIT.

## 4. EM4 Kalman Filter Application
**File:** `EM4_Kalman_Filter.ipynb`  
- Implemented a full Kalman Filter system for Vasicek model calibration.  
- Estimated latent short-rate states from observed yield data.  
- Visualized parameter convergence and model fit.
